# Fiscal-Point-Expense-Tracker-
This repository contains my college minor project, developed as part of my BSc IT curriculum. The project showcases my skills in web development and focuses on building a daily expense tracker. It allows users to add expenses, track their spending, and generate detailed reports. Feel free to explore the code and contribute!
